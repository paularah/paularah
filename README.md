### Hi there 👋
I am Paul Arah a software engineer. I am passionate about the Backend, Cloud, DevOps and Cloud-native technologies. I am also a big fan of Linux. My core skills include Golang, JavaScript, Python, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS and Linux.  When I am not actively coding, I enjoy being active in technical communities. I am currently an ambassador for the [Traefik](https://traefik.io/) reverse proxy community. I occasionally write on my blog here [https://dev.to/paularah](https://dev.to/paularah). I built and maintain [Ahantu](https://github.com/Ahantu) — a couple of open source tooling for geolocation in Rwanda. I recently started keeping a low budget Youtube channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgLDHwAR153t_Yv2cIi3z0g)😄 with mostly videos from a bootcamp where I teach. I am actively looking for an operations focused role (SRE, platform, infrastructure, production or DevOps).
