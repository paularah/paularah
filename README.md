### Hola👋 I'm Paul, 
 
I built a [popular](https://twitter.com/ArahPaul/status/1534999763095019523) tool - [Ahantu](https://www.ahantu.rw/)  for easily finding cells, villages, sectors, and districts from street addresses and geo coordinates in Rwanda. 

I am building [NextPesa](https://www.nextpesa.com/), A tool to aggregate mobile money transaction data💸. 

In my spare time, I enjoy mountain biking and trying out new trails🚴‍♂️. 

### Favourites Tools 🧵 🪡
* MongoDB(keeps your db problems till later).
* Golang(a true Swiss army knife, great for everyday needs while simultaneously low-level enough to do systems programming and all the cool networking stuff).
* Node.js.
* Kubernetes(sends you on a learning roller coaster that includes but is not limited to container internals, networking, security, deployment patterns and Linux).
* Vim (I heard it causes receding hairline, but it's worth it).
* Linux (Well, you can't run away from it)

### Currently Learning  📝 📌 
* Linux - through the LFCS curriculum, I won't be taking the certification itself. 
* Kubernetes - In preparation to get certified as a Certified Kubernetes Administrator(CKA). 
* Terraform, shell scripting, Kubernetes, and its tooling. 
* Random computer sciency things. 

### Currently Reading 📚 📖 
* Soft Skills: The software developer's life manual by John Sonmez 
* Google technical writing course -  Casually audited this courses a couple of years ago, but I've been writing more lately, and I'd benefit from going through the material again.
* Hands-On System Programming with Go by Alex Guerrieri — So I can pretend I'm smart on Twitter. 
* Concurrency in Go; tools and techniques for developers by Katherine Cox-Buday.
  

I occasionally write on my blog here [https://dev.to/paularah](https://dev.to/paularah).
I kept a low-budget [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgLDHwAR153t_Yv2cIi3z0g) while teaching at Solvit Africa — a bootcamp for budding software engineers.
