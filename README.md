### Hola👋 I'm Paul, 

I am a software engineer passionate about translating business requirements, objectives and goals into scalable products for users. My core skills include Golang, Node.js, MongoDB, Postgres, Docker, Kubernetes, and Linux.  
 
 I previously worked for a couple mostly failed startups like [Dankoob](https://dankoob.com/), [Fress](https://fress.app/), [JustSerp](https://justserp.com/). I have also done some random things like fellowships, internships, freelancing and consultancy for companies like [Libary Aid](https://librarytracker.org/)
 
I built a [popular](https://twitter.com/ArahPaul/status/1534999763095019523) tool - [Ahantu](https://www.ahantu.rw/)  for easily finding cells, villages, sectors, and districts from street addresses and geo coordinates in Rwanda. 

### Favourites Tools 🧵 🪡
* MongoDB(keeps your db problems till later).
* Golang(a true swife army knife, great for everyday needs while being simultaneusly low-level enough to do systems programming and all the cool networking stuff).
* Node.js.
* Kubernetes(sends you on a learning roller coaster that includes but not limited to container internals, networking, security, deployment patterns & linux).
* Vim (I heard it causes receding hairline, but it's worth it). 

### Currently Reading 📚 📖 
* Refactoring UI by Adam Wathan & Steve Schoger — I'm making intentional effort be better at building good UIs. 
* Hands-On System Programming with Go by Alex Guerrieri — So I can pretend I'm smart on Twitter. 
* Concurrency in Go; tools and techniques for developers by Katherine Cox-Buday.

### Currently Learning  📝 📌 
* Tailwind CSS — settled on this as my choice of tool for building UIs. 
* Postgres internals, advanced features and RDMS in general. 
* Terraform, shell scripting, kubernetes and its tooling. 
* Random computer sciency things. 
* Occasionally leetcode [here](https://leetcode.com/paularah/) with a particular interest in graph problems.

I am currently an ambassador for the [Traefik](https://traefik.io/) reverse proxy community. I occasionally write on my blog here [https://dev.to/paularah](https://dev.to/paularah).
I kept a low budget [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgLDHwAR153t_Yv2cIi3z0g) while teaching at Solvit Africa — a bootcamp for budding software engineers.
