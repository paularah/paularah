### Hi I'm Paul ðŸ‘‹
 I enjoy solving c probems, optimising processes and implementing solutions. I take pride in carefully documenting processes. My core skills include Golang, JavaScript, Python, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS and Linux.  

When I am not actively coding, I enjoy being active in technical communities. I am currently an ambassador for the [Traefik](https://traefik.io/) reverse proxy community. I occasionally write on my blog here [https://dev.to/paularah](https://dev.to/paularah). I built and maintain [Ahantu](https://github.com/Ahantu) â€” a couple of open source tooling for geolocation in Rwanda. I recently started keeping a low budget Youtube channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgLDHwAR153t_Yv2cIi3z0g)ðŸ˜„ with mostly videos from a bootcamp where I teach. I am actively looking for a role. If you're hiring, please reach out to me via email: [paularah.self@gmail.com](mailto:paularah.self@gmail.com)
